.TH "PCOCC-IMAGE" "1" "Jun 17, 2022" "0.7.0" "pcocc"
.SH NAME
pcocc-image \- List and manage VM and Container images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pcocc image [COMMAND] [ARG]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
List and manage virtual machine and container images.
.sp
All the subcommands of \fIpcocc image\fP operate on images stored in pcocc repositories. The list of pcocc repositories is defined in \fIrepos.yaml\fP (see \fI\%pcocc\-repos.yaml(5)\fP).
.sp
Images in repositories are uniquely identified by a name and revision number. In all pcocc commands and configuration files, images in repositories are specified with the following URI syntax: [REPO:]IMAGE[@REVISION]. If REPO is omitted the command will look in all defined repositories by order of priority until it finds a matching image. If REVISION is omitted, the highest revision of the image is selected.
.sp
Images are made of a stack of layers with each layer containing the differences from the previous layers. Layers can be shared between images in a repository which allows to reduce the storage footprint and speeds up operations by avoiding unnecessary data movement.

.B import [\-t fmt] [SOURCE] [DEST]
Import the source image file to an image in the destination repository. The destination image name must not already be used in the destination repository and the revision is ignored since the import operation creates the first revision of a new image. See below for supported file formats.
.TP
.B export [\-t fmt] [SOURCE] [DEST]
Export the source image file from a repository to the destination file.

.SS Supported file formats
.sp
The following VM image file formats can be imported or exported: \fIraw\fP, \fIqcow2\fP, \fIqed\fP, \fIvdi\fP, \fIvpc\fP, \fIvmdk\fP\&. By default, pcocc will try to guess the image format from its filename extension, or from the image content if possible. It can be specified with the \-t option if needed.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Container images can be imported / exported from remote Docker registries or local files by specifying them as follows:

.B copy [SOURCE] [DEST]
